## Technical Projects and Achievements

### LedgerLens (Fintech Copilot)
* [cite_start]**Award:** HuskyHack Winner (4th Finalists)[cite: 15].
* [cite_start]**Description:** Built a RAG-based fintech copilot for benefits and policy Q&A[cite: 15]. [cite_start]Used **conformal prediction** to bound error at target risk and enable the system to abstain under ambiguity or low coverage[cite: 16, 17].
* **Tech Stack:** RAG, Conformal Prediction, Rule-Based Reasoning.

### Airbnb Host Revenue and Occupancy Analytics Warehouse
* [cite_start]**Description:** Built a **Snowflake data warehouse** for the Seattle Airbnb dataset[cite: 55]. [cite_start]Designed a star schema and created a fact table with 1.4 million daily records[cite: 56].
* [cite_start]**Analysis:** Wrote analytical SQL to derive occupancy, pricing, and amenity metrics[cite: 58]. [cite_start]Quantified how room type and neighborhood affect price and occupancy for decision support[cite: 59, 60].
* **Tech Stack:** Snowflake, SQL, ETL.

### ML Regression on US Airline Data
* [cite_start]**Prediction:** Predicted flight fares using **XGBoost** based on origin, destination, and route features[cite: 49].
* [cite_start]**Delay Modeling:** Extended the analysis to 5.7 million US DOT on-time records to model delay probability[cite: 52]. [cite_start]Engineered weather and airport-congestion features and evaluated models using ROC curves and calibration plots[cite: 53].
* **Tech Stack:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Linear Regression, Random Forest.
