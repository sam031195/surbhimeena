## Core Research Focus
[cite_start]My research is centered on **Reliable & Verifiable ML/NLP**, focusing on Calibration, RAG, and Graph Neural Networks for decision support[cite: 23].

### GNN for Multi-Echelon Demand Forecasting
* [cite_start]**Project:** Built a **graph-neural-network prototype** with message passing over a multi-echelon interaction graph and a variational last layer[cite: 26, 27].
* [cite_start]**Goal:** Output **calibrated uncertainty** for risk-aware forecasts[cite: 27].
* [cite_start]**Findings:** Benchmarked against a deterministic LSTM baseline and observed improved error and coverage characteristics[cite: 28].

### Evidence-first Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Conflict Auditing
* [cite_start]**Project:** Prototyped a **detect-then-decode RAG pipeline**[cite: 34].
* [cite_start]**Methodology:** Used NLI models to audit contradictions and implemented a selective abstention policy when evidence was weak or conflicting[cite: 34].
* [cite_start]**Results:** Structured auditing reduced contradiction-tagged generations in stress tests while maintaining the fraction of answerable questions[cite: 36].

### Explainable Supplier Risk Modelling for SME Inclusion
* [cite_start]**Project:** Implemented **SHAP-based explanation pipelines** on generalized additive supplier-risk models[cite: 42, 43].
* [cite_start]**Goal:** Produced human-readable rationales to enable fairness audits focused on SME (Small and Medium-sized Enterprise) inclusion[cite: 43].
